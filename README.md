# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

In this project did a little bit focus and deep dive into algorithms and big O in C and  generally objectives were as below:
    * At least four different sorting algorithms
    * What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate time complexity of an algorithm
    * How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given output
    * What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Data Structure and functions
* For this project I had to use `print_array` and `print_list` functions:
    * [print_array.c](./print_array.c): Prints an array of integers
    * [print_list.c](./print_list.c): Prints a list of integers
* I included the header file `sort.h` that used to declare the prototypes of the functions in this program
* The data structure used for double linked list `typedef struct listint_s` also declared in `sort.h` header file

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:
* [Random.org](https://www.random.org/integer-sets/): Site to test the sorting algorithms

## Tasks :page_with_curl:
*   **0.Bubble sort**
    * [0-bubble_sort.c](./0-bubble_sort.c): A function that sorts an aray of integers in ascending order using the `Bubble sort` algorithm
    * [0-O](./0-O): Well indicated the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm
